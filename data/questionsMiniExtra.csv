Sincerity,"There's a colleague at work you don't particularly get along with, but they have access to resources that could help you on a project. Do you act extra friendly toward them to gain their favor, or do you remain genuine and avoid pretending to like them for personal gain?"
Fearfulness,"You're at a restaurant with friends, and the server brings you the wrong dish. It's not what you ordered, but you don't want to cause a scene. Do you mention the mistake or eat what you were given?"
Sociability,"You've just moved to a new city and you're attending an event where you don't know anyone. Do you actively introduce yourself to new people and try to make connections right away, or do you wait for others to approach you?"
Forgiveness,"You're working on a group project with someone who contributed significantly less than everyone else. As the team prepares to present the project, the person claims an equal share of the credit despite their minimal input. What would you do in this situation?"
Organization,"After a busy week, your home or office has started to get a bit cluttered. You have some free time today. Do you feel the urge to clean and organize your space right away, or do you leave it until later when the mess becomes more bothersome?"
Creativity,"You're offered two jobs: one is highly structured with clear tasks and routines, while the other requires more creativity and problem-solving. Do you prefer the routine-based job, or are you more inclined to take the creative role?"
